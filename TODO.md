when making a file, write constatns and all other variables to file
if loading, load all variables from file

after cleaning everything up, removing unnecessary code, etc, I need to do a complete audit of the code, and make sure everything is working as intended
making sure that the return grid is accurate, agent moves as it is supposed to, etc
